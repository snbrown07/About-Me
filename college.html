    <h2 class="pink">Who are you?</h2>
  <p class="go">My name is Shuwana Brown. I'm 16 years old and currently attending George Westinghouse High School. I moved to the United States when I was 7 years of age. I don't know being away from my mother would be so difficult and life changing at the same. The atmosphere in Jamaica was very different from New York's. Everywhere you go, everything you see is inspiring. The lights, the buildings, and the attractions inspire you to do what you want to become in life.</p>
  <h2 class="pink">What's your story? What strives to achieve greatness?</h2>
  <p class="go">I am not the most confident person in the world anymore. I wish I was. I struggled with self-esteem problems. Like every other awkward, low self-esteem teenage girl, I never wanted to be the center of attention. It made me uncomfortable and more awkward than I already am. Before I came to America, my mother say "you were the most confident person in your class" but that was hard for me to believe. When did all my confidences and love for myself go? I would ask myself that question whenever I look in the mirror. In addition to my self-esteem problems came another problem, not following my dreams. I have an unconditionally love for music. I grow up with music. Music is my heart, air, and soul. I would love to show the world what I got but confidences said "NO". How am I going to say "yes" when I've been rejected before? I never wanted to feel like that again. That was my 12-15 year old phase. I've grown and learned that life isn't always peaches and cream. There's going to be hardships and we're going to get rejected at times but it what you do afterwards that matter. You can't stop doing something you love because someone turned you down. You keep going and going until you satisfied with what you've achieve.</p>
